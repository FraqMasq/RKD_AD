# RKD_AD, Reverse Knowledge Distillation for Anomaly detection
This project is implemented for Politecnico di Milano Advanced Deep Learning Models and Methods PHD course, A.Y 2021/2022. 
The work is an implementation of [Reverse Knowledge Distillation for Anomaly Detection and Localization](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.10703v2.pdf). More info are available in the [report](./docs/report.pdf).

A mention to [anomalib](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/anomalib/tree/development/anomalib/models/reverse_distillation) implementation of the same model, from which the OCBE, Decoder and Anomaly Map generator components are integrated in our code.
